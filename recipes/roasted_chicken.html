    </p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
        <li>Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken inside and out.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
        <li>Stuff the cavity with celery.</li>
        <li>Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
    </ol>
